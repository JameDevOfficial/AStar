AStar (A*) is a visualization of the A* algorithm made in Lua using löve2d. The Algorithm is often used in video games for pathfinding or in networking. The programm allows to (almost) instantly render the algorithm or show an animation of its calculation. It also generates random grid while waiting in the menu.
